Finding the ideal place in my apartment to brew

I ran the python script on an Edison using a Grove shield to collect temp and light over 24 hours in five locations across my apartment. Ideally, we'd like to keep the [light low](https://byo.com/mr-wizard/effect-of-light-on-beer/) and the [temp low and steady](https://byo.com/article/controlling-fermentation-temperature-techniques/) to control environmental variables while brewing. Data was gathered during the late summer, and the brewing will take place in early fall, when it's cooler. So the variance in temperature rather than actual temperature is more important to deciding where the ideal place is to brew: that being the hallway.
